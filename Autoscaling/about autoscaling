If you know EC2 and cloudwatch  you will understand Autoscaling easily

=>Auto Scaling is a service that automatically monitors and 
adjusts compute resources to maintain performance for 
applications hosted in the AWS.

=>Alarm monitors CloudWatch metrics for Instance

Note:

=>Autoscaling group integrate with cloudwatch it monitor resources on particular metric you have selected.
cpu usage

eg: cpu reaches a particular threshold  ==> it can adjust the capacity based on cloud watch alarm(increase / descrease vm's)

=>while creating autoscaling group you also have to create cloudwatch alarms to add/remove capacity 

adding capacity:  to maintain performance
removing : to maintain cost

A launch configuration/Template 
----------------------------------
=>is an instance configuration template that an 
Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances.


Scaling policy:: 
-----------------
=>is used to increase and decrease the number of 
running instances in the group dynamically to meet changing 
conditions.

step 
scaling 

cpu >60   --> add 2 instance
cpu >80 --> add 4 instances


Autoscaling group ( launch template ) --> alarm (cloudwatch) --> scaling policy --> instances
