Check in ASG and target group of ALB "up" or not 

autoscaling group --> instance management -->  have few option "set standby" during patching or sth 
scaling protection -> dont get this instance to terminate

================================= ??????????????????????? ===================================

How do you make changes to these instances

"when autoscaling" vm instances will be dynamic (delete and create automatically by ASG) 
and launch from "template"

It will delete the instances --> when its launch it will launch from "AMI" from launch template.
Manually we can upgrade the instance but while "recreation" of ASG it will launch from "old AMI"
So all changes will going through "launch template" or laucn config.

all changes will going through "launch template":
------------------------------------------------
like  Instance group chanage --> instance type change - SG change - instance level change any 

Need to create new AMI --> new lauch template or config (or) --> create version of new launch template.

============================== What If you want to update with new code =====================================

Goto 

ASG --> Launch configuration -->Edit

under:
Launch configuration --> select "new launch config or template" ( created from new AMI ) of new code.  

Note:
====
Whenever you make change or update it will not automatic changes to the instance . you need to go "instance refresh"

to change instance --> click on --> start instance refresh

"start instance refresh" ==> means terminate the existing instance and recreate new instance from existing or new launch template.
( lauch config or launch template )

Refresh settings
Minimum healthy percentage
At least this percentage of the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group must remain healthy during this operation to allow it 
to continue.

======================\NOTE \=============================

For each and every "scaling (up/down) it trigger a "alert" "inAlarm" and send SNS notification and scale the instances.
