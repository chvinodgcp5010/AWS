Consider amazon aurora if you want to deploy Rds as "mysql" or "postgresql" consider Aurora ( cheap and fast )

Standard create --> MySQL --> Version ( select version according to use )

select all as default 

VPC security group:
-> create new sg : -> tcs-db-sg -->3306

MYSQL/Aurora 3306 from (MyIP)

Public access: No

Database authentication
-->Password authentication
Authenticates using database passwords.

Create database 

DB is accessed only internal so we are connecting ec2 instance to db to store the data.

Note:
We cannot access db over publicly because we disabled public access so I cannot access on My laptop.
to access this lauch ec2 instance on same VPC , same region and network 

================================= Launch ec2 instance ==================================

SG:
SSH 22 from (MyIP)

Need to install few packages on ec2 instance 


sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install mysql-server -y
mysql --version

TRY TO ACCESS DB FROM EC2 INSTANCE:
==================================

mysql -h tcsdbinstanceid.cqurymp8gyxh.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u tcsadmin -pjvrK0vM7tJzZ8im4QTF8

here:

-h  tcsdbinstanceid.cqurymp8gyxh.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com  ( From DB domain name ) 
-u tcsadmin                                       ( user creared as a part of rds creation )
-pjvrK0vM7tJzZ8im4QTF8                            ( password created while rds creation)

mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'tcsdbinstanceid.cqurymp8gyxh.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com' (110)

ERROR becaue of SG of Mysql we are onnly made from MyIP. So update SG of mysql and try 

check:

telnet tcsdbinstanceid.cqurymp8gyxh.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com 3306
Trying 172.31.92.178...

Here RDS of SG is not allowing anything from ec2 instance 

==================== ERROR ========================

Goto RDS and update SG 
here mysql access provided as MYIP (its useless because we are not exposing over public) mysql instance so remove the MYIP .
Instead update 

Mysql 3306     ---> sg of vm instance created (Mysql-client vm) or private ip address (ip/32)of that vm. ( ANY OF THE RULE WILL WORK ) ip oR sg

Once update the SG of RDS check using below 

On VM instance:
================================= RCA =========================

->telnet tcsdbinstanceid.cqurymp8gyxh.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com 3306
Trying 172.31.92.178...
Connected to tcsdbinstanceid.cqurymp8gyxh.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com.

NOW CONNECT TO RDS FROM EC2 INSTANCE:

->mysql -h tcsdbinstanceid.cqurymp8gyxh.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u tcsadmin -pjvrK0vM7tJzZ8im4QTF8
