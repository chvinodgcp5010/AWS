Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for theinternet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of
data at any time, from anywhere on the web.

Eg:

like google drive and dropbox.

UPload files and access from anywhere like doc, pics and videos everything like object only


S3 Basics:
=========
● It is Object-Based Storage
● When you upload data then Data is replicated across multiple facilities (AZ)
● Unlimited Storage
● Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets
● Bucket name has to be unique ( It has to be unique on the internet using name we can browse on internet)


A bucket is a logical unit of storage in Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Object Storage is a computer data storage architecture that manages data
as Objects.

like doc, pics and videos everything like object only. you have provide permission at bucket level or object level as well.


CREATION OF S3:
===============

Amazon s3 --> bucket --> folder --> object --> public access (based on permission public or pvt)

Scenario:
========

If suppose if we have appliaction Ec2 ( web app) need to store images data on S3 . Devops will create s3 and will assign permissions to it nd app developer 
will programmer add the details in appn to store images on s3

Ec2 ----> S3 <--- Ec2

Same like EFS --> we can store files at os level(folder)
S3 -> Programmatically access through appn.

S3 Storage types:
=====================


S3 Standard:
general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data.Fast access & object replication in multi AZ.

S3 One Zone-IA
is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Slow access, no object replication.

S3 IA– Infrequent Access:
Long-lived, but less frequently accessed data. Slow access,object replication in multi AZ

S3 Intelligent Tiering
Automatically moves data to most cost effective tier.

S3 Glacier:
Low Cost Storage class for data Archiving.

S3 Glacier Deep Archive
Lowest cost storage, retrieval time of 12 Hrs



LIFECYCLE POLICIES:
===================

amazon s3 standard access -->(30 days) s3 IA --> (30 days) One Zone IA -->(90 days) Glacier --> delete
