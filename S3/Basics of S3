Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the
internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of
data at any time, from anywhere on the web.

S3 Basics:
=========
● It is Object-Based Storage
● Data is replicated across multiple facilities
● Unlimited Storage
● Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets
● Bucket name has to be unique


A bucket is a logical unit of storage in Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Object Storage is a computer data storage architecture that manages data
as Objects.


CREATION OF S3:
===============

Amazon s3 --> bucket --> folder --> object --> public access

Scenario:
========

If suppose if we have appliaction need to store images data on S3 . Devops will create s3 and will assign permissions to it nd app developer will add the 
details in appn to store images on s3

Ec2 ----> S3 <--- Ec2

S3 Standard:
general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data.Fast access & object replication in multi AZ.

S3 One Zone-IA
is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Slow access, no object replication.

S3 IA– Infrequent Access:
Long-lived, but less frequently accessed data. Slow access,object replication in multi AZ

S3 Intelligent Tiering
Automatically moves data to most cost effective tier.

S3 Glacier:
Low Cost Storage class for data Archiving.

S3 Glacier Deep Archive
Lowest cost storage, retrieval time of 12 Hrs



LIFECYCLE POLICIES:
===================

amazon s3 standard access -->(30 days) s3 IA --> (30 days) any one of the AZ -->(90 days) Glacier
