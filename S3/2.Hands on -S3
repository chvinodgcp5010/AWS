S3 is  a global storage we can access anywhere . but we need to provide region ( based on appn users we can select region ) otherwise appn in 1 region and s3 
in other region it will be "high latency" ( long time to connect)

(based on the users access add region)

==================================================
Standard:
Frequently accessed data (more than once a month) with milliseconds access

Intelligent-Tiering:
Data with changing or unknown access patterns

Standard-IA:
Infrequently accessed data (once a month) with milliseconds access


One Zone-IA	Recreatable, infrequently accessed data (once a month) stored in a single Availability Zone with milliseconds access

Reduced redundancy:
Noncritical, frequently accessed data with milliseconds access (not recommended as S3 Standard is more cost effective)


========================================

By default whatever uploaded in s3 bucket are pvt.
and every access is denied by public.


If you want to make the data public (click public access)

========================================= CREATE BUCKET =======================================

After creating bucket "click on properties"

PROPERTIES:
============

versioning
tags
Intelligent tier
static website hosting

Server access logging:
======================
whatever and what source we got traffic from internet to s3 will store here ( create a directory ) 
if you want to store access log at some other place . mostly helpfull bucket is public and from where and who has accessed to it. you can select any target s3 
bucket.


PERMISSIONS:
============

by default all public level access is blocked .
One way you can make bucket public and not public.

Othrway to giving bucket policies -> You can specify nice json policy and who can access and how much they can access . 
you can specify Ip's and IAM users

if you want fine tune permissions you can use policies.


Access control list (ACL):
==========================
Grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts

you can make public to specific account of aws user. or you can make entire bucket to public also using ACL.



============================== CREATE BUCKET AND UPLOAD FILES ====================================

While uploading you can change configurations as well to change "Storage class" and "Server-side encryption" and change "permissions"


Permissions:
=============
Grant public access and access to other AWS accounts.
->Object Ownership
Control ownership of objects written to this bucket from other AWS accounts and the use of access control lists (ACLs). 
Object ownership determines who can specify access to objects.

ACLs disabled (recommended)
All objects in this bucket are owned by this account. Access to this bucket and its objects is specified using only policies.

ACLs enabled
Objects in this bucket can be owned by other AWS accounts. Access to this bucket and its objects can be specified using ACLs.


We can change storage class and encryption after upload of objecs as well.

========================

click on file and click on "open" it will open the file and able to download as well.

By default it will open file using "IAM user" we logged in AWS, We can access it over internet using default logged in user , while clicking on "open"

Also we have endpoint :

Object url:
===========

copy the access url and hit on browser . This is we  acces the url as "anonymous user" 

access denied, because object is "not public" 

https://tcs-dataview.s3.amazonaws.com/AWSSlides+(1).pdf

Error:

<Error>
<Code>AccessDenied</Code>
<Message>Access Denied</Message>
<RequestId>08MS9ZN81RCKYP41</RequestId>
<HostId>0NbHoIN8PqhXLfelI//QbAkBGFsDFZCvPprFnRo813enOuKRFn/C6WgtF40EhxdKtLAaALsuHMg=</HostId>
</Error>

Note:
When public read access is enabled and not blocked by Block Public Access settings, anyone in the world can access the specified objects.


NOTE:
=====
If you want to access over public first you need to change "permissions" from bucket and expose to "public"
after that you need to make object as public as well. otherwise only bucket permission change it will not work . both needed.

-> First you need to chanage from bucket "Make bucket as public" then Make object as "make public using ACL"

-> Once done try to access it using URL:
https://tcs-dataview.s3.amazonaws.com/2128_tween_agency.zip

you will be able to access it anywhere from internet ( Open to every one ) for other objects if not enabled to public it give "Access denied"

=========================
Use of S3:

upload data and access it from anywhere , you can give this to developer and dev will put theie in application code and to this endpint
data will be uploaded then the data will be over public.
