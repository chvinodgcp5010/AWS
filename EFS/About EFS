If you need shared storage "can go for EFS"

you can mount Efs file system in to any directory in to your OS.

it is scalable , elastic ,cheap

cluster of data to store in once centralised system " use EFS" just like EBS but EBS mount only 1 instance at a time. EFS for multiple filesystem
( shared file system)

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-ug.pdf

Use:
1.appn and development ( store from all ec2 images to centralized area )
2.database backups

Web service ( Ec2 VM ) all images to store in EFS (centralised location) ---> dynamic website

=========================================== EFS ====================================================
scenario:

Lets say we have cluster of web servers all will upload images to store in to the centralised from EC2 to efs.

I have a web servesr I need to store the images from specific folder to "central location" EFS .When multiple instances will store the data 
into same directory images data will sync on all servers.


First create a security group : 
------------------------------
Efs-sg
open port:  NFS       2047     allow from : security group of ec2 instance added

EFS:
---
dataweave-efs --->next 

VPC:
availabilty zone --> subnet --> security group ( Efs-sg ) -->next --> create
