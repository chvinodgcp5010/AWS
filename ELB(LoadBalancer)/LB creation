create 2 instances using "userdata" (userdatascript.sh)
ports: 22 , 80 ( MyIP )
port: 80 for security group of lb 

check ip you will get web access or not

create VM and create image from it ( custom AMI ) and use for remaining

instead of creating 1 by 1 vm instance --> provide all in 1 instance template and use that while deploying vm
